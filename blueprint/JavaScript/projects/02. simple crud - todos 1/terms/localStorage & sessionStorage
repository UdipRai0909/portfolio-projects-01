localStorage & sessionStorage
https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_win_sessionstorage.asp

What is localStorage in JavaScript?
A property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date.

This means the data stored in the browser will persist even after the browser window is closed.

Note
The sessionStorage object stores data for only one session.
(The data is deleted when the browser is closed).

localStorage and sessionStorage both work in the same fashion.

Set and retrieve localStorage name/value pair:

localStorage.setItem("lastname", "Smith");
localStorage.getItem("lastname");

Syntax
window.localStorage

or just:
localStorage

SAVE data to localStorage:
localStorage.setItem(key, value);

READ data from localStorage:
let lastname = localStorage.getItem(key);

REMOVE data from localStorage:
localStorage.removeItem(key);

CLEAR localStorage:
localStorage.removeItem(key);

Count the number of times a user has clicked a button:

if (localStorage.clickcount) {
  localStorage.clickcount = Number(localStorage.clickcount) + 1;
} else {
  localStorage.clickcount = 1;
}
